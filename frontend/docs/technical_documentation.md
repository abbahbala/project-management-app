## Project Allocation Algorithm
The allocation algorithm matches students to projects based on criteria such as:
- Skill levels
- Availability
- Past performance

### Steps:
1. **Fetch Data**: Retrieve lists of projects, students, and criteria from the backend.
2. **Allocate Projects**: Iterate through students and allocate them to projects based on the defined criteria.
3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure that cases where there are more students than projects or vice versa are managed.

## API Endpoints
- **GET /api/projects**: Fetches the list of projects.
- **GET /api/users?role=student**: Fetches the list of students.
- **GET /api/criteria**: Fetches the list of allocation criteria.
- **POST /api/allocate**: Triggers the allocation process.

## Code Structure
- **ProjectAllocationPage.js**: The main component handling the allocation process.
- **components/**: Contains sub-components like `ProjectList`, `StudentList`, and `CriteriaSelector`.
- **services/**: Contains service files for API interactions.

## Extending the System
- To add new allocation criteria, modify the `CriteriaSelector` component and ensure the backend supports the new criteria.
- Additional features like advanced reporting or more complex algorithms can be added by extending the relevant components and services.

## Deployment Notes
- Ensure all environment variables are correctly set up before deployment.
- Follow best practices for security, including SSL, authentication, and error logging.
